    ```php
    <?php
    return array(
        'modules' => array(
            // ...
            'Eye4web\ZfcUser\Ban'
        ),
        // ...
    );
    ```

Change 'banned' landing page
------------
If you want to use your own view, for the user banned landing page, all you have to is create a new view file in this
path: Â´view/eye4web/zfc-user/ban/index.phtml`.
Alternatively you can overwrite the route `eye4web_zfcuser_ban` and point it to your own controller.
